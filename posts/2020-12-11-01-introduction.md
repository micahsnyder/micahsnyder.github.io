# Introduction

Hi, I'm Micah Snyder. I'm what you might think of as a typical systems software developer. These days I primarily manage and develop on [a large cross-platform open-source C codebase](https://github.com/Cisco-Talos/clamav-devel). But I'm also an experienced and enthusiastic Python üêç programmer. In addition, I've taken a fascination with learning the Rust programming language ü¶Ä and can't wait to use it more professionally.

I haven't always been an open-source software contributor and, to be honest, I kind-of lucked into my current role as an open source product owner and lead developer. On this journey I've faced a non-stop series of challenges relating to project management, team leadership, inter-product collaboration, and of course software development. It's a fun ride!

I started this blog to share lessons that I've learned about software development and project leadership. I hope you'll find my blog useful or even inspiring.

If you're interested in my work, you can follow me on [GitHub](https://github.com/micahsnyder) and [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/micahsnyder) and follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/0xC0000063).

Until next time!

-Micah
