Hi, I'm Micah Snyder. I'm what you might think of as a typical systems software developer. These days I primarily manage and develop on [a large cross-platform open-source C codebase](https://github.com/Cisco-Talos/clamav-devel). I'm also an experienced and enthusiastic Python üêç programmer. Lately I've taken a fascination with the Rust ü¶Ä programming language. I'm still a novice Rustacean and can't wait to use Rust more professionally.

## Why blog?

I haven't always been an open-source software contributor. To be honest, I kind-of lucked into my current role as an open source product owner and lead developer. On this journey I've faced a non-stop series of challenges relating to project management, team leadership, inter-product collaboration, open source software release engineering, security vulnerability disclosure, and of course software development. It's a fun ride!

I started this blog to share some of the lessons that I've learned along the way.
