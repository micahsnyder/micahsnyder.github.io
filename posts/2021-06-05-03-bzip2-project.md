I am excited and honored to share that I will be taking up the role as [primary maintainer for the BZip2 project](https://people.gnome.org/~federico/blog/bzip2-changing-maintainership.html).

In 2019, Julian Seward handed over maintainership of the current stable release (1.0, currently at 1.0.8) to [Mark Wielaard at Sourceware](https://sourceware.org/git/?p=bzip2.git;a=summary), and maintainership of the [development of future releases to Federico Mena](https://people.gnome.org/~federico/blog/maintaining-bzip2.html). I joined in to help Federico as a developer, primarily focused on creating BZip2's new CMake build system.

Since picking up the project, Federico found less time to work on BZip2 than he had hoped. This past week while discussing my role and the future of the project, Federico surprised me with the question of whether or not I'd be interested in taking the reins. With some consideration, I agreed take ownership of the BZip2 development effort. Though I am particularly experienced with data compression theory, I have a strong background in C, have a keen interest in Rust, and have experience maintaining open source software.

I look forward working more with BZip2 and preparing the project for a 1.1 release.

***Important***: As a part of the ownership change, the BZip2 repository has been moved to a new "bzip2" group (org) on GitLab.
- Was: <https://gitlab.com/federicomenaquintero/bzip2>
- Is now: <https://gitlab.com/bzip2/bzip2>

Federico now maintains a fork of the project for his own development work. Unfortuantely, <https://gitlab.com/federicomenaquintero/bzip2> will not automatically redirect to <https://gitlab.com/bzip2/bzip2>.

Please update your links as needed to account for the URL change.
